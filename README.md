## Features

A simple block to show a rolling number.

Internally it supports the basic options of [react-countup](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-countup)

It allows setting the start and end values, the duration of the counting, the start delay, decimal and thousands separator, ...

It also allows adding a title and selecting its heading and position.

## Customization

You can restrict the list of allowed tags to render the title of the counter. Just modify the `titleTags` property of the block in your config:


```js
const applyConfig = (config) => {
  // Own blocks
  config.blocks.blocksConfig['countUpBlock']['titleTags'] = [
      ['h3', 'h3'],
      ['h4', 'h4'],
  ];

  return config;
};
```


## Installation

To install your project, you must choose the method appropriate to your version of Volto.


### Volto 17 and earlier

Create a new Volto project (you can skip this step if you already have one):

```
npm install -g yo @plone/generator-volto
yo @plone/volto my-volto-project --addon @codesyntax/volto-countup-block
cd my-volto-project
```

Add `@codesyntax/volto-countup-block` to your package.json:

```JSON
"addons": [
    "@codesyntax/volto-countup-block"
],

"dependencies": {
    "@codesyntax/volto-countup-block": "*"
}
```

Download and install the new add-on by running:

```
yarn install
```

Start volto with:

```
yarn start
```

### Volto 18 and later

Add `@codesyntax/volto-countup-block` to your `package.json`:

```json
"dependencies": {
    "@codesyntax/volto-countup-block": "*"
}
```

Add `@codesyntax/volto-countup-block` to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const addons = ['@codesyntax/volto-countup-block'];
```

If this package provides a Volto theme, and you want to activate it, then add the following to your `volto.config.js`:

```javascript
const theme = '@codesyntax/volto-countup-block';
```

## Test installation

Visit http://localhost:3000/ in a browser, login, and check the awesome new features.


## Development

The development of this add-on is done in isolation using a new approach using pnpm workspaces and latest `mrs-developer` and other Volto core improvements.
For this reason, it only works with pnpm and Volto 18 (currently in alpha).

-   [Make](https://6.docs.plone.org/install/create-project.html#make)
